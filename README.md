# content-azure-database-administrator-associate

Welcome to the official repo for the A Cloud Guru "Azure Database Administrator Associate (DP-300)" course. Here you will find resources to use alongside the videos and hands-on labs.

I hope that this content is useful both for those in the course as well as anyone else wanting to learn about administering Azure relational databases.

Happy learning!
